# CAmkES Overview

CAmkES (Component Architecture for Microkernel-based Embedded Systems) is a framework designed to simplify the development of component-based applications on the **seL4 microkernel**. It allows developers to build complex, secure systems using isolated components.

## Key Features
- **Component-based Design**: Modular architecture that enables better isolation and easier maintenance.
- **Inter-component Communication**: Provides controlled communication channels between components.
- **Security**: Leverages the security guarantees of the seL4 microkernel, such as fine-grained access control.
- **Real-time Systems**: Suitable for building real-time and high-assurance systems.

## Core Components
- **Interface Definition Language (IDL4)**: Defines the interactions between components.
- **Configuration Language**: Describes component instantiation, connection, and resource allocation.
- **Templates**: Helps generate the necessary code for component interfaces.

## Typical Use Cases
- **Embedded Systems**: Critical systems where security and safety are paramount.
- **Cyber-physical Systems**: Applications that require tight integration of software with physical components.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Secure execution of independent modules in robotics or automotive domains.
